Under different tau values, we gain different intercepts and slopes.

With tau=0.1, we gain the intercept 2685.04287 and the slope Black -244.36662, Married 94.20381, 
Boy 76.93263, Visit 9.24855, MomEdLevel 3.11109, MomSmoke -145.69383, CigsPerDay -8.69883, MomAge 2.98928, MomWtGain 9.99200;

With tau=0.5, we gain the intercept 3307.52108 and the slope Black -172.81036, Married 67.91586, 
Boy 120.69477, Visit 8.88944, MomEdLevel -1.94741, MomSmoke -160.69198, CigsPerDay -4.10805, MomAge 6.65264, MomWtGain 7.28421;

With tau=0.9, we gain the intercept 3923.19796 and the slope Black -155.92821, Married 66.31394, 
Boy 135.11268, Visit 3.15982, MomEdLevel -11.83779, MomSmoke -172.49730, CigsPerDay -2.57717, MomAge 9.21672, MomWtGain 6.93003.

As the tau value increases, we can conclude that the variables (Black, Boy, CigsPerDay, MomAge,MomAge^2) influences the baby weight more significantly from the increasing slopes; 
the variables (Married,Visit, MomEdLevel, MomSmoke, MomWtGain, MomWtGain^2) influences the baby weight less significantly from the increasing slopes.
